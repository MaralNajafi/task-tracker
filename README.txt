Hey, there!
This is Maral.

I've just started learning react by the time I'm uploading this, maybe less than a month.
This project is compeletely bulit on "react", using both class components and functional components.
I haven't yet learned "hooks" so I used class states for this project.

This app containes features like:

-tracking a new task
-tracking the local date and time of the task
-deleting the task
-marking the task as checked
-tracking the local date and time of the task checked


I haven't yet provided it with a local storage. And also some components can still split into smaller and more specific components.
However, I haven't yet mastered on how to pass data through components. So I kept it as simple and yet advanced as I could.

I hope you find it helpful and inspiring.
Good Luck!
Maral
